# gosupermodel-tools
Multiple tools to automate gosupermodel actions

So far, only a wardrobe challenge player has been implemented. It somehow doesn't work properly (sometimes the item groups are not properly detected or not clicked), but all of the logic is written. Feel free to open a PR if you find a way to make it work.


## Run the program

Change the credentials in the `variables.go` file
